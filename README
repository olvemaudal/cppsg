A C++ study group based on the TC++PL book
------------------------------------------

Here you find some material that I wrote and used during a C++ study
group that I facilitated in 2007. A group of developers agreed to read
50-100 pages from "The C++ Programming Language, 3rd edition" every
week and then I hosted a 1 hour quiz session based what we had just
read. 

Feel free to use these files for whatever you want. Derived work 
encouraged and feedback very much appreciated. Please contact me
if you want some advice and ideas about how to host your own
study group.

Enjoy,
