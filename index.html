<h1>
Study group for C++ - from Journeyman to Master<br>
</h1>

<ul>
<i>
If C gives you enough rope to hang yourself, C++ is a hardware 
store with lots of helpful people ready to tie knots for you. 
(Jack W. Reeves)
</i>
</ul>

The goal of this study group is to become <b>masters of C++ as a
group</b>, not only as a random bunch of clever individuals. Together
we will systematically build up our knowledge about this extremely
powerful but also difficult programming language.

<p>
First of all we will focus on learning the details of the language by
carefully reading through <b>the C++ book</b>, namely <a href="http://www.research.att.com/~bs/3rd.html">The C++ Programming Language</a> by
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/~bs/">Bjarne Stroustrup</a>.
The study group will be quiz-driven. We read 50 to 100 pages of
C++ theory every week. Then we meet for one hour to solve
and discuss related C++ questions. In the meetings we will also 
discuss good and bad practices and we will learn about the hidden 
gems and pitfalls of C++. 

<p>
This is certainly not a beginners course in C++ and programming - it
is an <b>advanced study group</b>. We will keep a very high pace and everybody
is expected to prepare themselves properly before each meeting. The
amount of preparation needed before each meeting depends on your
background. Some might spend just 1-2 hours skimming through the pages
of theory before each meeting, while others will need to do a lot of
additional practical programming and exercises to be fully prepared
for the meetings.

<p>
As a pre-requisite for this study group everybody is expected to have 
completed the book <a href="http://www.acceleratedcpp.com/">Accelerated C++</a> by 
<a href="http://www.acceleratedcpp.com/authors/koenig/">Andrew Koenig</a> and
<a href="http://www.acceleratedcpp.com/authors/moo/">Barbara E. Moo</a>.
This is probably the best introductory text to modern C++, and it focuses
on how the language <i>should be</i> used more than how it <i>might be</i> used. 

<p>
Each member of the study group will get a copy of these three books:
